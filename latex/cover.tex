\title{Shared Decision-Making and Control Between Humans and Adaptive Control Algorithms}

\author{Benjamin T. Thomsen}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
       \prevdegrees{B.Eng., McGill University (2015)}
\department{Department of Mechanical Engineering}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

\thesisdate{May 23, 2018}

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Anuradha M. Annaswamy}{Senior Research Scientist}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Rohan Abeyaratne}{Chairman, Department Committee on Graduate Theses}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}
% \end{abstractpage}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Anuradha Annaswamy for providing the instruction and support I needed to succeed in my research endeavors, and for teaching me how to approach unfamiliar subjects. I appreciate all the time she has devoted to clearing the hurdles for this work to progress, and to helping me learn to research effectively. I would like to thank Dr. Eugene Lavretsky for his enthusiastic support of my research, and for his valuable perspectives which have inspired me to think about the practical aspects of control design.

I owe thanks to all my colleagues in the Active Adaptive Control Laboratory for their guidance, teaching, and support which has contributed to this research. I would like to thank Max Zheng Qu in particular, whose advancements in adaptive control theory proved to be very useful in the development of this work, and whose repositories of code for control design and aircraft modeling and simulation saved me countless hours. Heather Hussain, Joey Gaudio, and Bitzy Flamholz have been invaluable resources to discuss ideas with, and I am grateful for the time they set aside to help me explore research ideas.

I am thankful for the support and inspiration of my friends throughout my time at MIT. Finally, I owe a great deal of gratitude to my parents for inspiring my passion for science and engineering that led me here.
