%This paper outlines a shared decision-making and control framework between adaptive controllers and human supervisors, able to recover control performance following anomalous changes in plant dynamics. Model reference adaptive control relies on accurate understanding of plant dynamics to guarantee stability and performance, and these guarantees are lost when severe anomalies introduce unexpected and unmodeled dynamics to the plant. We introduce a shared control architecture in which a human supervisor diagnoses anomalous closed-loop dynamic behavior and makes suitable changes to the control model of the system in order to recover nominal performance. This shared response allows for continued autonomous adaptive control without transferring control responsibilities to the human operator. Anomaly response with shared control is demonstrated on an unmanned very flexible aircraft (VFA) platform, whose actuators suddenly change from first-order to second-order.
%Changes to plant dynamics during operation, whether controlled manually by a human or autonomously by model-based control algorithms, can lead to instability and failure.

In this thesis we consider the problem of controlling a dynamical system subject to both parametric uncertainties and the sudden occurrence of severe changes in the dynamic architecture of the system. These anomalies, including the introduction of unmodeled linear dynamics or time delays, present difficulties in control for both human operators and autonomous model-based control algorithms. Online adjustment to asymptotically reject the effect of parametric uncertainty is possible through the proper use of adaptive control, and to a certain extent is paralleled by human learning and adaptation in manual control. Changes to the dynamic structure of the system, however, may lead to poor closed-loop performance and instability whether the control loop is being closed by a human or adaptive control algorithm.

We introduce a shared decision-making and control framework based on adaptive control which gives supervisory human operators a targeted responsibility in the mitigation of dynamical anomalies and enables the recovery of closed-loop system stability and command tracking performance without transferring control responsibilities to the human operator. This shared controller is defined in this thesis for systems where the full state is available for feedback as well as the case where only certain outputs are available for feedback. Anomaly response using this shared control architecture is demonstrated in several scenarios related to flight control, including the operation of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose actuators suddenly change from first-order to second-order.
